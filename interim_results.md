This tutorial describes how to get interim job results so you can apply post-processing as the job runs. For a detailed example, see the example [here](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-example).
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-interim-results}

Run your job and note the job ID.



## View the results
{: #view-results}

Use the job ID to see the results. To view the incoming job results as it runs, use the [get the job results stream API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-stream-job-logs-jid){: external} ([Swagger link](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_stream_job_logs_jid){: external}).
