{: note}

This tutorial walks you through the steps to upload a program to run a job on an IBM quantum computer. It assumes that you have already created a program by following the [create a program](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-create-program) instructions.  

If you do not want to create your own program, you can use one of the publicly available [sample programs](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-sample-programs) to [submit a job](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-run_job).
{: shortdesc}

Upload the program by using the [Upload a program](/apidocs/quantum-computing#post-program){: external} API directly or in [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Programs/post-program){: external}.

You must include the program name and a pointer to the program.  All other values are optional and are not validated except to verify that the format is correct.  For example, anything you specify for backendRequirements is just informational text for the user.
