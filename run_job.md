This tutorial walks you through the steps to use a program to run a job on an IBM quantum computer, then review the results. For a detailed example, see the example [here](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-vqe).
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #prerequisites}

You must have a quantum program. You can [create and upload a program](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-create-program), or use an existing one.


## Choose a program
{: #choose-program}
{: step}

Run the [List programs API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#list-programs){: external} to see a list of available quantum programs, including programs that you uploaded and public programs. You can optionally work with the API on [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Programs/list_programs){: external}. Note the ID of the program you want to run. You need this information to run the job.

The following sample programs are publicly available. For more information about these programs, including the required input parameters, see the [sample programs](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-sample-programs) topic.

- **sampler**:  
       Sample distributions generated by given circuits executed on the target backend.
- **circuit-runner**:  
       A runtime program that takes one or more circuits, compiles them, executes them, and optionally applies measurement error mitigation.
- **quantum-kernel-alignment**:  
       A quantum kernel alignment algorithm that learns, on a specific dataset, a quantum kernel that maximizes the SVM classification margin.
- **sample-program**:  
       A sample runtime program.
- **vqe**:  
       Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to find the minimal eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian.

## Run the job
{: #run-job-step}
{: step}

1. Use the [Run a job API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#create-job){: external} to run your job. Optionally, use [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/create_job){: external} to run the job. You must specify the program ID and can optionally supply parameters. Any other input is ignored. Note the job ID that is returned. You need this information to check the status and view results.
2. Run the [List job details API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-details-jid){: external}, manually or by using [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.test.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_details_jid){: external} to check the job's status. After completion, you can view the results. Alternatively, you can view the job results as it runs by using the [get the job results stream API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-stream-job-logs-jid){: external} ([Swagger link](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_interim_results_jid){: external}).

The amount of time the job runs is either maximum simulator time usage (3 hours) or the program cost, whichever is smaller. If your job does not complete before that limit is reached, it is automatically cancelled.  You will receive a notification and the List job details API will return  a status of 'cancelled - ran too long'.
 {: note}

## View the results
{: #view-results}
{: step}

Use the job ID to see the results.

- To view the job results after job completion, run the [list job results API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-results-jid){: external} ([Swagger link](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_results_jid){: external}).
- To view the incoming job results as it runs, use the [get the job results stream API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-stream-job-logs-jid){: external} ([Swagger link](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_stream_job_logs_jid){: external}).
