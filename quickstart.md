# Qiskit Runtime quick start guide
{: #create-configure}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="25m"}

This tutorial walks you through the steps to set up a Qiskit Runtime service instance, log into your service instance, and run your first job on a quantum computer.
{: shortdesc}


## Creating and configuring a Qiskit Runtime service instance
{: #create-configure}

1. [Create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration){: external} for the organization.
2. From the [user management page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/overview){: external}, invite users to join the account.

   The users must have {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts before they can be invited.
   {: note}

3. Create a Qiskit Runtime service instance:
   1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.quantum_long_notm}} Provisioning page](/catalog/services/quantum-computing){: external}, select the Create tab, then choose the appropriate service plan, depending on what you need access to:
      - **Lite**: Free simulators-only plan to help you get started with Qiskit Runtime. Learn to use Qiskit Runtime using our examples and tutorials for one of the pre-built programs available for executing circuits efficiently.
      - **Standard**: A pay-as-you-go model for accessing IBM quantum systems. Build your own programs and leverage all the benefits of Qiskit Runtime by running on real quantum hardware.
   2. After completing the required information, click **Create**.
4. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/iam/overview){: external}, click Manage > Access (IAM) to create an IAM access policy, ideally an access group policy, to give users access to the service instance. Optionally use resource groups, access groups, tags, and so on, to manage resources and access to them.

For more information about roles, including details about program level roles and instructions to work with access groups, see the [IAM access documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userroles){: external}.

### Access roles
{: #access-roles}

Following are the roles you can assign to access groups:

Action | Description | Roles
---|---|---
quantum-computing.program.create | Create programs and change program privacy | Manager, Writer
quantum-computing.program.read | View programs and program details | Manager, Reader
quantum-computing.program.delete | Delete programs | Manager, Writer
quantum-computing.program.update | Update programs | Manager, Writer
quantum-computing.job.create | Run jobs | Manager, Writer
quantum-computing.job.read | View job results and logs | Manager, Reader
quantum-computing.job.delete | Delete jobs | Manager, Writer

## Get ready to work with your Quantum Service instance
{: #access}

Next, you will find your account credentials and authenticate with the service.


1. Install these packages.  They let you create circuits and work with primitive programs via Qiskit Runtime. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Qiskit textbook.](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-appendix/qiskit.html){: external}. You need to keep these packages updated:
  ```Python
      pip install qiskit
      pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
  ```    
4. Install Qiskit Runtime: `pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime`.

1. Find and copy your API key. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API keys page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys){: external}, view or create your API key. Your key will look something like this: `I9sxojrwurPrMWqNR_wc4rztMgVqE1HUmsfACMyw_G9n`

3. Find your Cloud Resource Name (CRN) or service instance name.
  - To find your CRN, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console [Resource list page](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources){: external}, expand the "Services and software" section and look for your instance. Then click the row that contains your quantum service instance (don't click the name of the instance). In the pane that opens, click the icon to copy your CRN. For example:

   ```text
      crn:v1:bluemix:public:quantum-computing:us-east:a/b947c1c5a9378d64aed96696e4d76e8e:a3a7f181-35aa-42c8-94d6-7c8ed6e1a94b::
   ```

   - To find your servce instance name, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console [Resource list page](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources){: external}, expand the "Services and software" section and look for your instance.  The service instance name is in the **Name** column.
5. Call  `IBMRuntimeService` with your IBM Cloud API key and the CRN or Service name.

   You can use the name of your service instance instead of the CRN.  You can also optionally save your credentials on disk (in the $HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json file). By doing so, you only need to use IBMRuntimeService() in the future to initialize your account. If you don't save your credentials to disk, you have to run this command every time you start a new session.

   ```python
     from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService

     # Save account to disk.
     IBMRuntimeService.save_account(auth="cloud", token=<IBM Cloud API key>, instance=<IBM Cloud CRN or Service instance name>)

     service = IBMRuntimeService()
   ```

    To update your saved credentials, run `save_account` again, passing in `overwrite=True`  and the updated credentials.  For more information about managing your account see the [account management tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/tutorials/04_account_management.html){: external}.
